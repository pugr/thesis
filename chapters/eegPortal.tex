\subsubsection*{Hibernate}

Hibernate \cite{Hibernate:Home} is an open-source object-relational mapping framework, whose purpose is to facilitate storage and retrieval of Java domain objects. It is used in EEG/ERP Portal

\subsubsection*{Spring Framework}

The Spring Framework facilitates creating Java-based enterprise applications. It applies a principle called dependency injection which helps to make the classes loosely coupled. The idea of this principle is to let the framework do all necessary wiring of objects, so that the objects can focus on their core responsibilities. 

\subsubsection*{Wicket}
... The EEG/ERP Portal's presentation layer is being developed in Wicket by the time of writing this thesis
